Near Future :
==================
~~1) Implement Python Logger to output to console and access logs + cli logs (info + error)~~  
~~2) Package the solution and provide a simple install script~~  
3) GET on classification needs a server with internet access (inbound + outbound) :( need to test that  
4) In 'CREATE' operations, you should provide a dialogue interface as well as the ability to provide a JSON
    formatted file as user input.  
5) Figure out what to do additionally for snapshot restores(dest param)  
6) Have to work on assets - granules  
7) Policy modification ..
~~8) Move away from ID's to names ! (dont make customers use policy_id ... instead let them use policy_name)~~
9) Need to add filters in REPORT CREATION  
10) Modifying REPORTS doesn't have the right method listed in the guide  
~~11) Policy creation~~

Way out :
==================
~~11) Add a configuration file for different configuration parameters for CLI~~  
12) See if Multi-threading is applicable  
13) See if daemonizing the program is beneficial   
14) SSL Certificate for CloudPoint (Instead of ignoring SSL errors)
